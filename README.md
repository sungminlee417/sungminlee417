## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a fullstack software engineer who is passionate about writing and consistently learning more about code. I really enjoy problem solving, and being able to constantly think about code even while being away from my computer. I love the idea of being part of a development team that create innovative and functional web applications, and being able to physically see consumers making use of a product that I took part in designing.

Prior to coding, I have an extensive background in the performance arts. I majored as a Classical Guitar Performance major for my Bachelor's and Master's degrees, and I am the recipient of multiple competition awards and certifications. 

I have experience coding up projects in Javascript and Python. I have used frameworks and other technologies such as React/Redux, Express, Flask, Sequelize, and SQLAlchemy for these projects.
